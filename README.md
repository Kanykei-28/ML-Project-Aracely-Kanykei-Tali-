This is the final project aimed at developing a machine-learning tool for the classification of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease into affected and unaffected patients based on MRI scan images. 
The dataset is composed of 6400 images from MRI studies. Dataset can be accessed via https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/alzheimer-mri-dataset/data 

Three distinct approaches were employed to differentiate Alzheimer's disease. The initial strategy involved utilizing classification algorithms on statistical features extracted from the image data. The subsequent method enhanced this by incorporating frequency components from a 2-D Fourier transform (FFT2) to statistical features extracted from the first method. The final method entailed deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that processed the images directly.

This repository includes 4 files. Three Jupyter notebooks for the three methodologies, and one pdf file for the project report.
